Barnsley Fern is an iterated function system creating various fern fractals by 
four affine transformations given by:

         |a  b|   |x|   |e|
f(x,y) = |    | * | | + | |
         |c  d|   |y|   |f|

A data file contain the coefficients for the four affine transformations including
probability factors for each transformation.
The data file start with  line definingcthe probability factors followed 
by 4 lines of coefficients defining each transformation.

Data file example:

0.0 0.55 0.92 0.99 1.0
0.85 0.04 -0.04 0.85 0.0 1.6
0.2 -0.26 0.23 0.22 0.0 1.6
-0.15 0.28 0.26 0.24 0.0 0.44
0.0 0.0 0.0 0.16 0.0  0.0

Where the first line is the probability factors:
0.0 0.55 0.92 0.99 1.0

for fi between p(i) - p(i+1)

And the following lines are the four affine transformations given by:

         a       b      c      d     e    f
     -------------------------------------  
f1     0.85    0.04  -0.04   0.85  0.0   1.6
f2      0.2   -0.26   0.23   0.22  0.0   1.6
f3    -0.15    0.28   0.26   0.24  0.0  0.44
f4      0.0     0.0    0.0   0.16  0.0   0.0


Changing the probability factors and/or the affine transformations coefficients give 
different types of ferns. See the examples in the data directory.


Usage of the program: The program write the result to standard output which can be directed 
to a file and e.g been shown by gnuplot like:

  $ ./barnsley_fern ./data/fern.dat > foo.dat
  $ gnuplot
  > set view map
  > plot 'foo.dat' with points lt 2
